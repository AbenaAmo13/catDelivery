# Cat Delivery API and Frontend
NestJS Backend and React Vite and Typescript frontend to display delivery information
For this application to work, environment variables need to be set up:

In the backend directory.js, create a .env file with the following. This is an example
```
CORS_ORIGINS='http://localhost:5173'
PORT=3000
```

In the frontend directory, create a .env.local or a .env file. An example can be:

```
VITE_NEST_BACKEND_BASE_URL= http://localhost:3000
```
